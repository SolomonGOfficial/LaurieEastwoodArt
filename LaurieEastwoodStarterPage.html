      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm so happy you found your way here. <br> <br>
        
        I'm Laurie Eastwood; a passionate creator of colorful, symbolic art, seen through the lens of wonder and curiosity. <br> <br>

        As an artist and retreat leader I encourage everyone to concentrate less on creating a master piece and more on mastering peace.  <br> <br>
        
        I am a stand for possibility and the magic and mystery in the unknown; found when we dig deep and follow our soul's inklings. I believe we have to lose our mind to find our heart! <br> <br>
        
        I've declared myself an artist for over 40 years. My 1st foray was in the world of black-and-white hand tinted photos which I sold successfully in the wholesale market.  After 12 years I left the business. It had become too familiar and it was then I began my journey to understand and embrace the creative process. <br> <br>
        
        My art now is intuitive, colorful and filled with symbolism and it's always playful and fun! <br> <br>
        
        My inspiration comes from nature and noticing. Noticing patterns, play, changes, color, symbols, sounds, shadows, light, connection and sacred geometry. <br> <br>
        
        What lights me up is playing in my studio, being curious and letting the art speak to me. It has become a metaphor for life. <br> <br>
        
        I love to share my wonder in the process and love to see the transformation when peoole discover the joy in their individual expression. <br> <br>
        
        I hope youâ€™ll join me!
      
      </p>
